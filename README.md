# Fake Http Client

This is some test-automation to be used with CS 260's Assignment 3:
the Http Proxy assignment. Originally all of this was written using .BAT
but increasingly, getting that to work is becoming an issue. In particular:
we want the invocations of the client program to be simultaneous, and that
is difficult to do with PowerShell and BAT files.

This is all still VERY experimental.
